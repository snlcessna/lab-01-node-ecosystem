* **.eslintignore** - contains the course linter ignore configuration
* **lib/** - contains module definitions
* **__test__/** - contains unit tests

## Feature Tasks
#### Greet Module
Create a NodeJS module in the lib/ directory named `greet.js` that exports a single function.
* The `greet` function should have a single parameter (arity of one) that should expect a string as it's input
* The `greet` function should return the input name, concatenated with "hello ": eg. ("hello susan")
* The `greet` function should return `null` if the input is not a string

#### Arithmetic Module
Create a NodeJS module in the lib/ directory named `arithmetic.js` that exports an object. This module should have `add` and `sub` methods that implament addition and subtraction.  
* The `add` method should have an arity of two (define two paramiters)
  * If either parameter is a non-number the function should return null
  * Else return the sum of the 2 numbers
* The `sub` method should have an arity of two (define two paramiters)
  * If either parameter is a non-number the function should return null
  * Else return the second paramiter subtracted from the first paramiter

## Testing  
#### Greet Module Tests
* Write a test that expects the greet module to return `null` when you supply non string values
* Write a test the expects the greet module to return `'hello world'`
  * This should happen when invoked with `'world'` as the first argument

#### Arithmetic Module Tests
* Test each method for proper use (invoded with number arguments)
* Test each method for inproper use (invoded with one or more non-numner arguments)

## Documentation  
In your README.md describe the exported values of each module defined in your lib/ directory. Every function description should include it's airty (expected number of paramiters), the expected data for each paramiter (data-type and limitations), and the it's output behavior (for both valid and invalued use). Feel free to write any additional information in your README.md.
<!----lab-larry--->
The arithmetic.js file declares module.exports function for addition and subtraction. It first performs a check to ensure that the a and b values are in fact a number. If it passes the test then it returns the sum of a and b, or, in the case of function 'sub' it will return a minus b. If either test fails then the function will return a 'null'.
